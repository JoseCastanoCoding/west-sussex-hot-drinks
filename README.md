West Sussex Hot Drinks is a website aimed to to model the operation of a hot drinks machine. Based on the selection of a customer, the application will be required to make a drink according to a recipe for each choice.   

Based on the selection by the customer the application needs only to provide a readout on the actions performed during the preparation of the drink.
